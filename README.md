# iot_project-DTU

## Description:
 
This project enters into the practical application of knowledge that learns in the IoT lectures. The students, two in number, should create a full complete IoT communication/application, that is to say to data collection from sensors to their exploitation in a cloud service and visualization on an interface application. 

This project requires approximatively 300 hours of work (150 hours each), schedule of October until the end of December and represent 10 ECTS. The students could work in DTU campus or at home during their free time. The examination will be a full project report and should document the requirements, analysis, design, implementation and test.

## Task to do:

* Create a low power consumption electronic system which recovers data in a room with a set of sensors (pressure, temperature, CO2, etc.). The used board is a Sodaq Explorer, and students need to make at least two, to create a mini cluster.
* Connect these objects to a LoraWan gateway and upload all record data in a cloud. For this student will use the DTU’s gateway and “The Things Network” service.
* Develop an iOS application to watch in real time all the information about collected data. We could watch, for instance, the state of each system, the last data collected, the data history, a map where all sensors are plotted, make an alert, etc.
* Make the end to end communication secure, with a set of security protocols.
* The collected data could be analyses, to detect if a person is in a room, if there is a fire in the building, etc. according to the collected data.
* Additives tasks could propose regarding the project progress.
